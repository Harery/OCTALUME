## Analysis Scope

Please analyze this codebase and provide:

### 1. Project Overview
- Primary language(s) and frameworks
- Project type (web app, CLI, library, etc.)
- Architecture pattern (monolith, microservices, etc.)

### 2. Directory Structure
Map the key directories and their purposes:
```
project/
├── src/           # What's here?

├── config/        # Configuration approach?
└── ...
```

### 3. Entry Points
