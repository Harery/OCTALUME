# Our Community Promise 

**Hi there! We're really glad you're here.**

This document exists because we care deeply about creating a safe, welcoming space for everyone. We know "code of conduct" can sound formal and intimidating, so let's be clear about what this really means:

**We're all human beings first, developers second.**

This community is built by people, for people. Every question you ask, every bug you report, every feature you suggest—behind every interaction is a real person with feelings, experiences, and a life outside of code.

**Let's treat each other that way.**

---

## Why This Matters

**A quick story:** A few years ago, a new developer asked a "basic" question in a community forum. Someone replied with a snarky "read the docs." That developer never asked another question publicly again. They eventually left the community entirely.

**One interaction.** That's all it took.

We don't want that here. We want a community where:
- Everyone feels safe to participate
- Questions are welcomed, not mocked
- Mistakes are learning opportunities, not failures
- Diversity is celebrated, not just tolerated
- Beginners feel as valued as experts

**That's the community we're building together.**

---

## What We Expect from Everyone

###  The Good Stuff (Do This!)

**Be welcoming and inclusive**
- Greet new community members warmly
- Use language that includes everyone (avoid assumptions about gender, background, experience)
- Remember: not everyone speaks English fluently—be patient with communication differences

**Be respectful of different perspectives**
- You'll encounter people with different experiences, opinions, and approaches
- That's not a bug—it's a feature! Diversity makes us stronger
- Disagreement is okay; disrespect is not

**Accept feedback gracefully**
- Constructive criticism isn't personal—it's how we grow
- "Have you considered..." means "I want to help you improve," not "you're wrong"
- You don't have to agree with all feedback, but listen with an open mind

**Focus on what's best for the community**
- Sometimes that means compromising for the greater good
- Sometimes it means stepping back to let others lead
- Always ask: "Does this help the community thrive?"

**Show empathy**
- Remember: everyone is fighting a battle you know nothing about
- A harsh comment might hit harder than you intend
- Kindness costs nothing but means everything

**Share knowledge generously**
- Answer questions patiently, even "basic" ones
- Document what you learn so others benefit
- Mentor others when you can—someone once helped you

**Encourage thoughtful discussion**
- Ask questions more than you make statements
- "Tell me more about your approach" beats "you're wrong"
- The best ideas come from collaborative thinking

###  The Not-Okay Stuff (Don't Do This)

**Harassment in any form**
- Sexualized language or imagery (ever)
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments
- Personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing private information without consent (doxing)

**Unprofessional conduct**
- Discrimination based on race, gender, sexuality, religion, disability, age, or background
- Threats or intimidation
- Deliberate embarrassment or humiliation
- Dismissiveness or condescension

**If you're unsure:** Ask yourself, "Would I say this to my grandmother?" If the answer is no, don't say it here.

## Our Responsibilities

**As maintainers, we pledge to:**

 Lead by example (we follow these standards too!)

 Respond to all reports seriously and promptly

 Investigate thoroughly before taking action

 Apply consequences fairly and consistently

 Protect privacy when handling reports

 Create an environment where everyone feels safe

 Be transparent about our processes

**We don't always get it right,** but we commit to trying our best and learning from mistakes.

---

## Scope: Where This Applies

**This code of conduct applies everywhere:**

 In all project spaces (issues, PRs, discussions, docs)

 In official communication channels (Discord, Slack, email lists)

 When representing the project publicly (conferences, social media)

 In private interactions related to the project

**The bottom line:** If you're engaging with our community, these standards apply. No exceptions.

---

## Reporting Issues: We've Got Your Back

**If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:**

**Please report it.** We know speaking up can be scary, but we've got your back.

**How to report:**
- Email: octalume@harery.com
- Include what happened, who was involved, and any context (screenshots, links, etc.)

**What happens next:**
1. **We'll acknowledge within 24-48 hours** (sooner if urgent)
2. **We'll investigate** thoroughly and confidentially
3. **We'll take appropriate action** based on severity
4. **We'll follow up with you** and keep you informed

**Our promises to reporters:**
 **Privacy:** We won't share your name without your permission
 **Safety:** We'll take immediate action if there's ongoing harm
 **Support:** We'll provide resources and support throughout the process
 **No retaliation:** We protect reporters from backlash

**You're not alone.** We'll handle it together.

## Consequences (Hopefully Never Needed)

**We really, really hope we never have to use this section.** But for clarity:

**Consequences vary by situation:**
- First offense (minor): Private warning and discussion
- Second offense or serious offense: Temporary or permanent ban
- Severe or illegal behavior: Immediate ban and possible legal action

**We consider context:**
- Was it intentional or accidental?
- Is the person willing to make amends?
- Is this a pattern or a one-time mistake?
- How severe was the impact on others?

**Our goal isn't punishment—it's protecting the community.** We'll always choose the path that keeps everyone safe.

---

## A Note on Intent vs. Impact

**Something important to understand:**

> "I didn't mean to offend you" doesn't undo the harm caused.

**Intent matters, but impact matters more.**

If someone says your behavior hurt them:
-  Don't say: "You're too sensitive"
-  Don't say: "I was just joking"
-  Do say: "I'm sorry, I didn't realize. Thank you for telling me. I'll do better."

**Growth requires acknowledging impact,** even when intent was good. We're all learning together.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**"Does this mean I can't disagree with anyone?"**
→ Absolutely not! Disagreement is healthy. Just disagree respectfully. Attack ideas, not people.

**"What if I accidentally say something offensive?"**
→ It happens! Apologize sincerely, learn from it, and move forward. We value growth over perfection.

**"Isn't this just common sense?"**
→ Most of it, yes! But writing it down sets clear expectations and helps everyone feel safer.

**"What if I see someone violating this but I'm not the target?"**
→ Please report it! Bystander intervention protects our community. We'll handle it confidentially.

**"Is this enforceable? How?"**
→ Yes. We can and will ban users, delete content, and restrict access when needed.
