# 🚀 OCTALUME Quick Start Guide

**Get started in under 2 minutes — no installation hassles**

---

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** installed ([Install Guide](https://claude.ai/code))
- **Git** (to clone the repository)

That's it. No npm, no pip, no Docker, no configuration files to edit.

---

## 🏃 Immediate Start (Copy & Paste)

```bash
# 1. Clone the framework
git clone https://github.com/Harery/OCTALUME.git

# 2. Enter the directory
cd OCTALUME

# 3. Start Claude Code
claude
```

**Done!** OCTALUME loads automatically when Claude Code starts.

## 🎯 Your First Command

Once Claude Code is running, try:

```
Initialize a new project for [describe your project]
```

**Example:**
```
Initialize a new project for an inventory management system with:
- User authentication
- Product tracking
- Stock alerts
- Reporting dashboard
```

Claude will:
1. Create your project structure
2. Generate 200-500 features from your description
3. Set up git repository
4. Start you in Phase 1
