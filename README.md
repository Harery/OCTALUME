## 💡 Why OCTALUME Exists

Building software is hard. Building it **right** — with clear vision, proper governance, and complete traceability — is harder still.

You've seen projects spiral out of control:
- Requirements shift constantly
- Stakeholders pull in different directions
- Security becomes an afterthought
- Compliance gets tacked on at the end
- Documentation lags behind reality

**OCTALUME fixes this.**

**Octa** = 8 phases | **Lume** = light/guidance

We guide you through the entire software lifecycle — from that first spark of an idea to production operations — ensuring nothing falls through the cracks while keeping your team aligned, your stakeholders informed, and your project on track.

---

## 🎯 What You'll Achieve

> **Real talk:** Enterprise software development is complex. OCTALUME doesn't hide that complexity — it gives you a clear path through it.

<summary><strong>🔍 Deep dive: Each phase explained</strong></summary>

### Phase 1: Vision & Strategy

**The problem you solve:** Teams often dive into building without clarity on *why* they're building it and *what success looks like*.

**What you'll create:**
- **Business Case:** Why this project matters to the business
- **PRD (Product Requirements Document):** What exactly you're building
- **Success Metrics:** How you'll measure achievement

**Outcome:** Executive buy-in, budget approval, and crystal-clear product vision.

### Phase 2: Requirements & Scope

**The problem you solve:** Vague requirements lead to rework, delays, and frustration.

**What you'll create:**
- **Requirements List:** Every feature, clearly defined
- **Traceability Matrix:** Link requirements to business goals
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Know when each requirement is met

**Outcome:** Clear scope that prevents scope creep while ensuring nothing critical is missed.

### Phase 3: Architecture & Design

**The problem you solve:** Technical decisions made reactively create technical debt.

**What you'll create:**
- **System Architecture:** How all components fit together
- **Technology Choices:** What tech stack and why
- **Threat Models:** Security designed in, not bolted on

**Outcome:** A technical blueprint that guides implementation with confidence.

### Phase 4: Development Planning

**The problem you solve:** "We'll figure it out as we go" doesn't work at enterprise scale.

**What you'll create:**
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Every task identified
- **Resource Plan:** Who does what, when
- **Sprint Plan:** 2-week sprints with clear goals

**Outcome:** A realistic timeline with proper resource allocation.

### Phase 5: Development Execution

**The problem you solve:** Long development cycles without feedback lead to wasted effort.

**What you'll approach:** Agile sprints with:
- 2-week sprint cadence
- Daily standups (15 minutes)
- Sprint reviews with stakeholders
- Retrospectives for continuous improvement

**Outcome:** Working software delivered incrementally with constant feedback.

### Phase 6: Quality & Security Validation

**The problem you solve:** Finding bugs in production is expensive and dangerous.

**What you'll validate:**
- **Functional Testing:** Does it work as specified?
- **Security Testing:** Is it secure?
- **Performance Testing:** Is it fast enough?
- **UAT:** Do actual users accept it?

**Outcome:** Confidence that your software is production-ready.

### Phase 7: Deployment & Release

**The problem you solve:** Deployments often fail due to poor preparation.

**What you'll ensure:**
- **Deployment Plan:** Step-by-step deployment process
- **Rollback Plan:** What if something goes wrong?
- **Smoke Tests:** Quick verification of success

**Outcome:** Smooth, controlled production releases.

### Phase 8: Operations & Maintenance

**The problem you solve:** Software needs ongoing care after launch.

**What you'll provide:**
- **Monitoring:** Track health and performance
- **Incident Response:** Handle issues quickly
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regular updates and enhancements

**Outcome:** Reliable, stable production operations.

**Starting Point:** Sarah, a Product Owner, needs to build an e-commerce platform.

**With OCTALUME, here's her journey:**

**Phase 1: Vision & Strategy (Weeks 1-6)**
```
Sarah creates a Business Case answering:

## 🔗 Traceability: Tracking Everything

Every artifact follows the format: **`P{N}-{SECTION}-###`**

**Examples:**
- `P1-VISION-001` — Phase 1, Vision document, item 1
- `P3-ARCH-042` — Phase 3, Architecture, item 42
- `P5-CODE-789` — Phase 5, Code commit, item 789

**The traceability chain:**

```
Epic → Feature → Story → Commit → Build → Artifact → Release → Test → Result
```

**Why this matters:** When something goes wrong (or right!), you can trace it back to the original decision, requirement, or stakeholder request.

---

## 🛡️ Built-In Compliance

OCTALUME supports these regulatory frameworks out of the box:

| Regulation | Industry | What's Covered |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| **HIPAA** | Healthcare | PHI protection, breach notification |
| **SOC 2** | Services | Security, availability, privacy controls |
| **PCI DSS** | Payments | Card data security, vulnerability scanning |
| **SOX** | Public companies | Financial controls, audit trail |
| **GDPR** | EU data | Data subject rights, breach notification |
| **DoD/ITAR** | Defense | CMMC, controlled technical data |

**How it works:** Compliance requirements are identified in Phase 1, designed into the architecture in Phase 3, tested in Phase 6, and maintained in Phase 8.

---

## 📋 Common Issues: We've Got You Covered

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code not loading OCTALUME?</strong></summary>

**Symptom:** CLAUDE.md content not available when you start Claude Code

**Most likely cause:** You're not in the OCTALUME directory

**Quick fix:**
```bash
# Check where you are
pwd
# Should show: /path/to/OCTALUME

# If not, navigate there
cd /path/to/OCTALUME

# Try again
claude
```

**Still not working?** Make sure the `.claude` directory exists:
```bash
ls -la .claude/
# You should see: CLAUDE.md, ORCHESTRATOR.md, etc.
```

**If `.claude` is missing:** Re-copy OCTALUME including hidden files:
```bash
cp -r /source/OCTALUME/ /destination/OCTALUME/
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>MCP tools not appearing in Claude Code?</strong></summary>

**Symptom:** MCP server tools don't show up in Claude Code

**Most likely cause:** Dependencies not installed correctly

**Quick fix:**
```bash
cd .claude/mcp-server
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
cd ../..
```

**Verify installation:**
```bash
ls .claude/mcp-server/node_modules/
# You should see a list of installed packages
```

**Still failing?** Check Node.js version:
```bash
node --version
# Must be 18+ for MCP server compatibility
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can't move to the next phase?</strong></summary>

**Symptom:** Phase transition blocked

**Most likely cause:** Exit criteria not met for current phase

**What to do:**
```bash
# In Claude Code, ask:
"We've completed Phase [X]. Validate exit criteria and run go/no-go."
```

**Claude will:**
1. Check all exit criteria for your current phase
2. Verify entry criteria for the next phase
3. Identify any gaps or blockers
4. Help you resolve issues
5. Run the go/no-go decision once ready

**Common blockers:**
- Missing deliverables → Complete them
- Unsigned approvals → Get signatures
- Failed quality gates → Fix and retest
- Incomplete documentation → Update docs

</details>

---

## 🎓 Methodology: Best of Both Worlds

**Not 100% Agile — not fully Waterfall. OCTALUME gives you the best of both.**

### Formal Phases (1-4, 6-8)
- Structured deliverables
- Go/No-Go decisions
- Documentation requirements
- Quality gates

### Agile Execution (Phase 5 only)
- Sprint planning (2-week sprints)
- Daily standups
- Sprint reviews
- Retrospectives

**Why this hybrid works:** Upfront planning and architecture prevent expensive mistakes, while Agile execution gives you flexibility and rapid feedback during development.
