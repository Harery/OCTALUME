# Testing OCTALUME on a Fresh Linux System

**Welcome, future tester!** You're about to take OCTALUME for a spin on a clean Linux installation. I know testing can feel intimidating—especially with a new framework—but don't worry. We've designed this guide to be your patient companion through every step.

---

## What You'll Need

Let's make sure your system is ready before we begin. Think of this as checking your toolkit before starting a project—you want everything in place before you dive in.

### System Checklist

- [ ] **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 11+, or CentOS 8+
- [ ] **RAM**: At least 4GB (8GB will make your life nicer)
- [ ] **Disk Space**: 500MB free
- [ ] **Internet**: Required for downloads and Claude Code login

---

## Let's Verify Your System

Before we install anything, let's check what you're working with. These commands will tell us about your environment.

```bash
# Check your OS version
cat /etc/os-release

# Check available memory
free -h

# Check disk space
df -h
```

**What you should see:**
- OS version matching the requirements above
- Memory showing at least 4GB total
- Disk space showing at least 500MB available

<details>
<summary>🔧 Something doesn't match?</summary>

**Problem:** Your OS version is older than required.

**Solution:** Consider upgrading to a supported version, or proceed with caution—you may encounter dependency issues.

**Problem:** Low on memory or disk space.

**Solution:** Close unnecessary programs to free RAM. For disk space, clear temporary files with `sudo apt clean` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `sudo yum clean all` (CentOS).

</details>

---

## Step 1: Installing Node.js and npm

Node.js is the foundation that Claude Code runs on. Let's get it installed.

```bash
# Install Node.js 18+ (Ubuntu/Debian)
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Verify the installation
node --version
npm --version
```

**What you should see:**
```
v18.x.x  # (or higher - this is good!)
9.x.x    # (or higher - this is good!)
```

<details>
<summary>❌ Error: "node: command not found"</summary>

This means Node.js didn't install properly. Let's fix it:

```bash
# Try installing build essentials first
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential

# Then reinstall Node.js
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>⚠️ Warning: Version too old</summary>

If you see a version lower than 18, you'll need to update:

```bash
# Remove old version
sudo apt-get remove -y nodejs npm

# Install fresh Node.js 18+
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

</details>

---

## Step 2: Installing Git

Git helps us clone the OCTALUME repository. Let's make sure it's available.

```bash
# Install git
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y git

# Verify the installation
git --version
```

**What you should see:**
```
git version 2.x.x  # (any 2.x version is fine)
```

<details>
<summary>❌ Error: "git: command not found"</summary>

If git isn't found, the install command above should fix it. If you still have issues, try:

```bash
# For Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install -y git-core

# For CentOS
sudo yum install -y git
```

</details>

---

## Step 3: Installing Claude Code

This is the exciting part—installing the AI assistant that will help you build amazing things!

```bash
# Install Claude Code globally
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Verify the installation
claude --version
```

**What you should see:**
```
claude version x.x.x  # (any version number means success!)
```

**Celebrate!** You've just installed Claude Code. Now let's log in so you can start using it.

```bash
claude login
```

**What will happen:**
1. Your default browser will open automatically
2. You'll be prompted to log in to your Anthropic account
3. After successful login, you'll see a confirmation message
4. Return to your terminal—you're ready to go!

<details>
<summary>❌ Error: Browser doesn't open</summary>

If your browser doesn't open automatically (common on headless servers), you'll see a URL in the terminal. Copy it and paste it manually into your browser.

</details>

<details>
<summary>❌ Error: "Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'"</summary>

This usually means npm's global path isn't set up. Try:

```bash
# Add npm global path to your .bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$(npm config get prefix)/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Then try claude --version again
claude --version
```

</details>

---

## Step 4: Cloning OCTALUME

Now let's get the OCTALUME framework onto your system.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Harery/OCTALUME.git
cd OCTALUME

# Look at what we got
ls -la
```

**What you should see:**
```
✅ README.md              # Framework overview
✅ SETUP_GUIDE.md         # How to use it
✅ CLAUDE.md              # Auto-loaded context
✅ .claude/               # Configuration (hidden directory)
✅ skills/                # Phase and shared skills
✅ LICENSE                # License information
```

**Welcome home!** You're now standing in the OCTALUME directory. This is where the magic happens.

---

## Step 5: Installing MCP Server Dependencies

OCTALUME includes a custom MCP server that provides powerful lifecycle management tools. Let's set it up.

```bash
# Navigate to the MCP server directory
cd .claude/mcp-server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Check that everything installed
ls node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/
```

**What you should see:**
```
✅ node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/  # Success!
```

<details>
<summary>❌ Error: "EACCES: permission denied"</summary>

This is a common permission issue. Let's fix it:

```bash
# Fix npm permissions
mkdir -p ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Try npm install again
npm install
```

</details>

---

## Step 6: Verifying Your Installation

Let's make sure everything is in place before we start testing.

```bash
# Return to project root
cd ../..

# Check all required directories
ls -la .claude/
ls -la skills/
```

**What you should see:**

For `.claude/`:
```
✅ mcp-server/      # MCP server with dependencies
✅ agents/          # Agent configurations
✅ commands/        # Claude Code commands
✅ skills/          # Additional skill files
✅ hooks/           # Event hook scripts
```

For `skills/`:
```
✅ phase_01_vision_strategy/
✅ phase_02_requirements_scope/
✅ phase_03_architecture_design/
✅ phase_04_development_planning/
✅ phase_05_development_execution/
✅ phase_06_quality_security/
✅ phase_07_deployment_release/
✅ phase_08_operations_maintenance/
✅ shared/          # Cross-cutting skills
```

**You're ready to test!** Everything should be in place now.

---

## Testing OCTALUME

Now for the moment of truth—let's see if OCTALUME works as expected.

### Test 1: Starting Claude Code

```bash
# From the OCTALUME root directory
claude
```

**What should happen:**
- Claude Code starts and displays a welcome message
- CLAUDE.md is automatically loaded (this gives Claude context about OCTALUME)
- You see the OCTALUME framework context available

**Let's verify it's working:**

Ask Claude:
```
What is OCTALUME and what are its 8 phases?
```

**Expected response:**
Claude should explain that OCTALUME is an enterprise 8-phase software development lifecycle framework and list all 8 phases:
1. Vision & Strategy
2. Requirements & Scope
3. Architecture & Design
4. Development Planning
5. Development Execution
6. Quality & Security
7. Deployment & Release
8. Operations & Maintenance

<details>
<summary>❌ Claude doesn't know about OCTALUME</summary>

If Claude doesn't respond with OCTALUME information, CLAUDE.md might not be loading. Check:

```bash
# Verify CLAUDE.md exists
ls -la CLAUDE.md

# If it exists, try restarting Claude
exit  # Exit Claude
claude # Start it again
```

</details>

---

### Test 2: Creating Your First Project

Let's initialize a simple project to see the framework in action.

**Ask Claude:**
```
Initialize a new OCTALUME project for a simple todo list application with:
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks
- Simple user interface

Target: Personal users
Budget: $5,000
Timeline: 2 months
```

**What should happen:**
1. ✅ Claude creates the project directory structure
2. ✅ Claude generates a feature list (200-500 features for a full project)
3. ✅ Claude initializes a git repository
4. ✅ Claude creates an artifacts directory for documentation
5. ✅ Claude starts Phase 1: Vision & Strategy

**Let's verify:**

```bash
# Check if project was created
ls -la

# Check the project state
cat .claude/project-state.json

# Check for artifacts directory
ls -la artifacts/
```

**What you should see:**
```
✅ .claude/project-state.json  # Project tracking
✅ artifacts/P1/               # Phase 1 artifacts directory
✅ feature_list.json           # Generated feature list
✅ .git/                       # Git repository initialized
```

<details>
<summary>❌ Error: "Project state not found"</summary>

If the project didn't initialize properly, try again with a clearer prompt:

```
Initialize a new OCTALUME project for a todo app.
```

If that fails, check that you're in the OCTALUME directory and that CLAUDE.md exists.

</details>

---

### Test 3: Creating a Business Case

Let's create your first artifact!

**Ask Claude:**
```
Create the Business Case for this todo list application project.
```

**What should happen:**
- Claude creates a comprehensive business case document
- Includes executive summary, market analysis, and financial projections
- Saves it to the artifacts directory with proper naming

**Let's verify:**

```bash
# Check if the file was created
ls -la artifacts/P1/

# View the business case
cat artifacts/P1/P1-VISION-001-business-case.md
```

**What you should see:**
```
✅ P1-VISION-001-business-case.md
```

The file should contain:
- Executive summary
- Problem statement
- Market analysis
- Financial projections (ROI, costs)
- Recommendation

<details>
<summary>❌ Artifact not created</summary>

If the artifact wasn't created, check the artifacts directory:

```bash
# Check if directory exists
ls -la artifacts/

# If P1 doesn't exist, create it
mkdir -p artifacts/P1

# Try creating the business case again
```

</details>

---

### Test 4: Creating a PRD (Product Requirements Document)

**Ask Claude:**
```
Create the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for this project.
```

**What should happen:**
- Claude creates a detailed PRD
- Includes user personas, user stories, and requirements
- Saves with proper traceability naming

**Verify:**

```bash
cat artifacts/P1/P1-VISION-002-prd.md
```

**What you should see:**
```
✅ P1-VISION-002-prd.md
```

The file should contain:
- Product overview
- User personas
- User stories
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements

---

### Test 5: Checking Traceability

One of OCTALUME's superpowers is complete traceability. Let's see it in action.

**Ask Claude:**
```
Show me the current project status and traceability information.
```

**What you should see:**
- Current phase (Phase 1: Vision & Strategy)
- List of artifacts created with their P{N}-{SECTION}-### identifiers
- Feature list with traceability information
- Project progress summary

**Why this matters:**
Every artifact, decision, and deliverable is tracked. You can always trace back to see why something was built a certain way.

---

### Test 6: Quality Gate Validation

OCTALUME has quality gates at every phase transition. Let's test one.

**Ask Claude:**
```
Complete Phase 1 and run go/no-go decision to move to Phase 2.
```

**What should happen:**
1. Claude validates Phase 1 exit criteria
2. Claude checks Phase 2 entry criteria
3. Claude provides a go/no-go recommendation
4. Claude updates the project state if approved

**What you should see:**
- Validation of Phase 1 deliverables
- Assessment of Phase 2 readiness
- Clear recommendation (Go or No-Go)
- Explanation of the decision

<details>
<summary>⚠️ No-Go decision: What now?</summary>

A No-Go decision isn't failure—it's quality control! Claude will tell you exactly what's missing. For example:
- "Business case incomplete—missing financial projections"
- "PRD lacks user stories for admin features"

Address the missing items and run the quality gate again.

</details>

---

## Edge Case Testing

Great frameworks handle edge cases gracefully. Let's test a few.

### Edge Case 1: Empty Project State

**Scenario:** Starting OCTALUME with no existing project.

```bash
# Remove project state if it exists
rm -f .claude/project-state.json

# Start Claude
claude
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Claude detects no project exists
- Claude prompts you to initialize a new project
- Framework continues to work normally

**Why this matters:** Users should be able to start fresh at any time.

---

### Edge Case 2: Corrupted Project State

**Scenario:** Project state file gets corrupted.

```bash
# Create a corrupted project state (don't worry, we'll fix it)
echo '{"invalid": json}' > .claude/project-state.json

# Start Claude
claude
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Claude detects the corruption
- Claude offers to recover or reinitialize
- Framework provides clear guidance

**Recovery:**
```bash
# Remove the corrupted file
rm .claude/project-state.json

# Start fresh
claude
```

**Why this matters:** Files get corrupted. The framework should handle it gracefully.

---

### Edge Case 3: Missing Skill Files

**Scenario:** A skill file is accidentally deleted.

```bash
# Temporarily move a skill file
mv skills/phase_01_vision_strategy/SKILL.md /tmp/

# Start Claude
claude
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Claude detects the missing skill
- Claude provides a clear warning message
- Framework continues to function (other phases still work)

**Recovery:**
```bash
# Restore the skill file
mv /tmp/SKILL.md skills/phase_01_vision_strategy/
```

**Why this matters:** Accidents happen. The framework should be resilient.

---

### Edge Case 4: Large Feature Lists

**Scenario:** Projects with hundreds of features.

OCTALUME is designed to handle projects with 200-500 features. Let's verify performance remains good.

**Ask Claude:**
```
Show me how many features are in this project and display the first 10.
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Claude displays the feature count
- Claude shows the first 10 features
- Performance remains snappy

**Why this matters:** Enterprise projects have lots of features. The framework shouldn't slow down.

---

### Edge Case 5: Concurrent Sessions

**Scenario:** Multiple Claude sessions accessing the same project.

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd /path/to/OCTALUME
claude

# Terminal 2 (open a new terminal window)
cd /path/to/OCTALUME
claude
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Both sessions start
- Framework provides warning about concurrent access
- File locking prevents corruption

**Why this matters:** Teams might accidentally work on the same project. The framework should handle it.

---

## Performance Testing

Let's make sure OCTALUME runs smoothly on your system.

### Performance Test 1: Framework Loading Time

**Test:** How fast does the framework load?

```bash
# Time the framework loading
time claude --prompt "Show me the framework structure"
```

**Expected results:**
- ✅ < 3 seconds: Excellent
- ✅ < 5 seconds: Good
- ⚠️ ≥ 5 seconds: Acceptable but consider system resources

<details>
<summary>🐌 Slow loading? Here's why</summary>

Slow loading can be caused by:
- Low RAM (close other programs)
- Slow disk (consider SSD)
- Large project files (consider archiving old artifacts)

</details>

---

### Performance Test 2: Memory Usage

**Test:** How much memory does OCTALUME use?

```bash
# Monitor memory while running Claude
/usr/bin/time -v claude --prompt "List all phases"

# Look for "Maximum resident set size" in the output
```

**Expected results:**
- ✅ < 1GB: Excellent
- ✅ < 2GB: Good
- ⚠️ ≥ 2GB: Monitor during extended use

---

### Performance Benchmarks

Here's what we aim for:

| Metric | Excellent | Good | Acceptable |
|--------|-----------|------|------------|
| Framework Load Time | < 3s | < 5s | < 10s |
| Memory Usage (Idle) | < 500MB | < 1GB | < 2GB |
| Memory Usage (Active) | < 1GB | < 2GB | < 4GB |
| MCP Response Time | < 50ms | < 100ms | < 200ms |

---

## Verification Tests

Let's verify specific components are working correctly.

### MCP Server Test

```bash
# Navigate to MCP server directory
cd .claude/mcp-server

# Start the server
node index.js
```

**What you should see:**
```
✅ MCP Server listening on port 3000
✅ Loaded 9 lifecycle tools
```

**Press Ctrl+C to stop the server**

<details>
<summary>❌ Error: "Cannot find module 'express'"</summary>

Dependencies might not be installed. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

Then try starting the server again.

</details>

---

### File Permissions Test

Hook scripts need to be executable. Let's verify.

```bash
# Check hook script permissions
ls -la .claude/hooks/*.sh
ls -la .claude/memory/*.sh
```

**What you should see:**
```
✅ -rwxr-xr-x  # Executable script (755 permission)
```

<details>
<summary>❌ Wrong permissions?</summary>

If scripts show `-rw-r--r--` (not executable), fix them:

```bash
# Make hook scripts executable
chmod +x .claude/hooks/*.sh
chmod +x .claude/memory/*.sh

# Verify the fix
ls -la .claude/hooks/*.sh
```

</details>
