## Executive Summary

**This is your elevator pitch - make it count!** Think of this as the "movie trailer" for your project. It should give busy stakeholders a clear picture of what you're proposing, why it matters, and what they'll get in return.

**Write 2-3 paragraphs covering:**
- What problem you're solving (the pain point)
- What solution you're proposing (the cure)
- What benefits you'll deliver (the happy ending)

**Example to inspire you:**
> "Our current customer service system takes 3 days to respond to inquiries. Customers are frustrated, and our competitors are winning. We propose building an AI-powered chatbot that responds in seconds, 24/7. This will cut response time by 98%, improve customer satisfaction by 40%, and save significant operational costs annually."

**Write your executive summary:**
[Your 2-3 paragraph summary here. Start with the problem, describe your solution, and end with the expected outcomes.]

## 1. Business Problem

### 1.1 Current State

**Paint a picture of what's happening right now.** Help readers feel the pain that your users or business are experiencing.

**Ask yourself:**
- What does the current situation look like?
- What's broken, slow, expensive, or frustrating?
- Who is affected and how?

**Example prompts:**
- "Our team spends 15 hours per week manually..."
- "Customers are abandoning their carts at a rate of..."
- "The system crashes whenever traffic spikes..."
- "We're losing significant revenue each month because..."

**Write your current state here:**
[Describe what's happening now - use real numbers if you have them, or realistic estimates. Tell the story of the problem.]

### 1.2 Problem Statement

**Now state the problem clearly in one or two sentences.** This is your "mission statement" - it should be crystal clear.

**Example:**
> "Our legacy e-commerce platform cannot handle peak traffic, resulting in $5M annual revenue loss and declining customer satisfaction."

**Write your problem statement:**
[One clear sentence that captures the core problem]

### 1.3 Impact

**Make the consequences real.** What happens if we do nothing? This creates urgency and justifies the investment.

**Consider these impacts:**
- **Financial**: Revenue loss, increased costs, missed opportunities
- **Customer**: Churn, satisfaction drops, negative reviews
- **Competitive**: Market share loss, falling behind
- **Operational**: Team burnout, inefficient processes
- **Strategic**: Missed goals, delayed growth

**Example:**
> "If left unaddressed, we will lose $5M annually, our market share will decline 15% year-over-year, and customer churn will increase 5% per quarter."

**Write your impact analysis:**
[Quantify the impact with numbers. Be realistic but compelling. What will happen if we don't solve this problem?]

## 2. Proposed Solution

### 2.1 Solution Overview

**Describe your solution in plain language.** Imagine explaining it to someone smart but non-technical.

**Think about:**
- What are you building or changing?
- How will it work at a high level?
- What's the core approach or technology?

**Example:**
> "We'll build a cloud-native mobile app that connects customers with local service providers in real-time. The app will use geolocation, real-time messaging, and secure payments to create a seamless experience."

- **Secure payments** via Stripe
- **Ratings and reviews** to build trust

**List your key features:**
[What are the 5-10 main things your solution will do? Focus on user value, not technical details.]

### 2.3 Target Users

**Who will use this solution?** Understanding your users is critical to success.

**Think about:**
- **Primary users**: The main people who will use it daily
- **Secondary users**: People who interact with it occasionally
- **Admin users**: People who manage or configure it

**For each group, describe:**
- Who they are (role, demographics)

**Break it down:**
- **TAM** (Total Addressable Market): Everyone who could possibly use this
- **SAM** (Serviceable Addressable Market): The segment you can realistically reach
- **SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable Market): What you can capture in the next 3-5 years

**Example:**

## 4. Financial Analysis

### 4.1 Cost Estimates

**How much will this cost?** Be realistic and include all major categories.

| Category | What It Covers | Estimated Cost |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Development | Team salaries, contractors | $[amount] |
| Infrastructure | Servers, cloud services, tools | $[amount] |
| Operations (Year 1) | Support, maintenance, monitoring | $[amount] |
| **Total Year 1** | | **$[amount]** |

**Tips:**
- Include one-time costs (setup, migration)
- Include ongoing costs (hosting, licenses)
- Add a 15-20% buffer for surprises
- Consider phasing costs over multiple years

**Example:**
| Category | Year 1 |
|----------|--------|
| Development | $1,500,000 |
| Infrastructure | $300,000 |
| Operations | $400,000 |
| **Total** | **$2,200,000** |

**Complete your cost estimates:**
[Break down the costs. Where will the money go? Be specific but don't get bogged down in details.]

### 4.2 Revenue Projections

**What financial benefits will this deliver?** This is the "return" part of ROI.

**Consider:**
- Direct revenue (new sales, subscriptions)
- Cost savings (efficiency, automation)
- Avoided costs (not hiring, not fixing crises)

**Project 3 years out:**

| Year | Revenue / Savings | Growth | Notes |
|------|-------------------|--------|-------|
| Current | $[baseline] | - | Starting point |
| Year 1 | $[projected] | [%] | Ramp-up period |
| Year 2 | $[projected] | [%] | Full adoption |
| Year 3 | $[projected] | [%] | Optimization |

**Example:**
| Year | Revenue | Growth |
|------|---------|--------|
| Current | $10,000,000 | - |
| Year 1 | $12,000,000 | 20% |
| Year 2 | $15,600,000 | 30% |
| Year 3 | $19,500,000 | 25% |

**Complete your revenue projections:**
[What financial benefits will this generate? Be optimistic but grounded in reality.]

### 4.3 ROI Analysis

**The moment of truth: is this worth it?** Calculate your return on investment.

**Key metrics:**
- **Total Investment**: Sum of all costs
- **Total Return**: Sum of all benefits
- **Net Return**: Return minus Investment
- **ROI**: (Net Return / Investment) × 100
- **Break-even**: When benefits exceed costs

**Example:**
> **Total Investment**: $4,700,000 (3 years)
> **Additional Revenue**: $17,100,000 (3 years)
> **Net Return**: $12,400,000
> **ROI**: 264%
> **Break-even**: Month 14

**Calculate your ROI:**
[What's the return on investment? When will we break even? Is this a good investment compared to alternatives?]

### 5.2 Risk Assessment

**What could go wrong, and how will we handle it?** Being honest about risks builds trust.

**For each risk, assess:**
- **Impact**: How bad would it be? (High/Medium/Low)
- **Probability**: How likely is it? (High/Medium/Low)
- **Mitigation**: How will we prevent or minimize it?

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Plan |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| [Risk 1 - e.g., Cost overrun] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [How you'll prevent it] |
| [Risk 2 - e.g., Timeline delay] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [How you'll prevent it] |
| [Risk 3 - e.g., Adoption challenge] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [How you'll prevent it] |

**Example:**
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Cost overrun | High | Medium | Fixed-price contracts, scope control |
| Timeline delay | Medium | Medium | Agile methodology, regular check-ins |
| Adoption risk | Medium | Low | User training, gradual rollout, support |

**Complete your risk assessment:**
[What are the main risks? How serious are they? What's your plan to handle them?]
