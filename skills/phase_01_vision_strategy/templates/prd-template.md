## 1. Product Overview

**This is your product's "North Star" - everything you build should point in this direction.**

### 1.1 Product Vision

**What does success look like in 3-5 years?** Paint an inspiring picture of where this product is going.

**Think about:**
- What problem are you ultimately solving?
- What impact will you have on users' lives?
- What will make this product remarkable?

**Example to inspire you:**
> "We will become the trusted platform that connects millions of local service providers with customers in their moment of need. We'll make finding help as easy as ordering a ride, creating reliable income for providers and peace of mind for customers."

**Write your product vision:**
[Your inspiring long-term vision. What does the world look like when your product succeeds?]

### 1.2 Product Goals

**What will you achieve in the next 6-12 months?** These are your concrete, measurable milestones.

**Good goals are SMART:**
- **Specific** (clear what you're achieving)
- **Measurable** (you can track progress with numbers)
- **Achievable** (realistic given your resources)
- **Relevant** (connected to your vision)
- **Time-bound** (you'll know when you've arrived)

**Example:**
> - Launch MVP with 50 beta customers by Q2
> - Achieve 4.5-star rating in app stores by Q3
> - Reach 10,000 active users by end of Year 1
> - Process significant transaction volume by month 12

**Write your product goals:**
[What specific, measurable outcomes will you achieve? When?]

### 1.3 Success Metrics

**How will you know if you're winning?** Define the numbers that matter most.

| Metric | Why This Matters | Target | How We'll Track It |
|--------|-----------------|--------|-------------------|
| [Example: Daily Active Users] | [Shows real engagement, not just signups] | [5,000 by month 6] | [Analytics dashboard] |
| [Example: Conversion Rate] | [Measures how many visitors become users] | [10% by month 3] | [Funnel analytics] |
| [Example: Net Promoter Score] | [Shows user satisfaction and loyalty] | [+50 by month 6] | [In-app surveys] |

**Define your success metrics:**
[What numbers will tell you you're on the right track? What targets will you aim for?]

---

## 2. User Personas

**Who are you building this for?** Understanding your users deeply is the secret to building products people love.

### 2.1 Primary Personas

**These are your main users - the people who will use your product every day.**

#### Persona 1: [Give them a name - e.g., "Busy Mom Sarah" or "Startup Founder Mike"]

**Demographics** (Who they are):
- Age: [e.g., 32-45]
- Location: [e.g., Urban areas]
- Occupation: [e.g., Working parent with 2 kids]
- Tech comfort: [e.g., Comfortable with smartphones, not tech expert]

**Goals** (What they're trying to achieve):
- [Example: "Find reliable childcare in under 10 minutes"]
- [Example: "Book appointments without making phone calls"]
- [Example: "Feel confident that providers are trustworthy"]

**Pain Points** (What frustrates them now):
- [Example: "Wastes hours calling providers who don't pick up"]
- [Example: "Never knows if a provider is available until asking"]
- [Example: "Worried about letting strangers into her home"]

**Behaviors** (How they currently solve the problem):
- [Example: "Asks Facebook mom groups for recommendations"]
- [Example: "Keeps a spreadsheet of provider contacts"]
- [Example: "Tries to book everything months in advance"]

**Quote** (Give them a voice):
> [Example: "I just need someone I can trust, and I need to find them fast. I don't have time to interview ten people."]

#### Persona 2: [Add another primary persona if applicable]

[Repeat the structure above for your second primary persona]

### 2.2 Secondary Personas

**These people interact with your product occasionally or in supporting roles.**

#### Secondary Persona 1: [Name - e.g., "Customer Service Rep Alex"]

[Describe them using the same structure: demographics, goals, pain points, behaviors]

**Why they matter**: Even though they're not daily users, their needs are important for your product to work well.

---

## 3. User Stories

**Now let's break down what users need into concrete, actionable stories.** Each story represents something valuable a user wants to do.

### Epic 1: [Epic Name - e.g., "User Onboarding"]

**An Epic is a big feature area that contains multiple related stories.**

#### Story 1: [Story Title - e.g., "Sign Up with Email"]

**As a** [persona: e.g., "Busy Mom Sarah"]
**I want** [action: e.g., "create an account using my email and password"]
**So that** [benefit: e.g., "I can save my preferences and book faster next time"]

**Acceptance Criteria** (How we'll know this story is done):
- [ ] User can enter email, password, and confirm password
- [ ] System validates email format
- [ ] Password must be at least 8 characters with letters and numbers
- [ ] User sees a clear error message if passwords don't match
- [ ] After signing up, user is logged in automatically
- [ ] Confirmation email is sent to the user's inbox

**Priority**: P0 | P1 | P2 | P3
**What this means**:
- **P0** (Must have): Can't launch without it
- **P1** (Should have): Very important, but could launch temporarily without it
- **P2** (Nice to have): Would be great to have
- **P3** (Later): Future enhancement

**Estimate**: [Story points or hours - e.g., "3 points" or "4 hours"]

#### Story 2: [Story Title - e.g., "Sign Up with Google"]

**As a** [persona]
**I want** [action]
**So that** [benefit]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] [Criterion 3]

**Priority**: P0 | P1 | P2 | P3
**Estimate**: [Story points or hours]

### Epic 2: [Epic Name - e.g., "Search and Discovery"]

[Continue with additional epics and stories. Think about the complete user journey from first visit to regular use.]
